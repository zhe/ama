# Ask me anything!

This idea is very interesting. You can ask a question by creating a new issue on this repo, so that I will try to asnser it as soon as I can.

This ask-me-anyting repo is forked from [@mdo's ama repo](https://github.com/mdo/ama) which is forked from [@holman's feedback repo](https://github.com/holman/feedback).
